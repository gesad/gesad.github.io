I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [Federal University of Ceará] (http://ufc.br/) (UFC), Fortaleza, Brazil, in 2015. During my undergraduate studies, I was supported by the [Brazilian agency CNPq] (http://cnpq.br/). Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the [State University of Ceará] (http://www.uece.br/uece/) (UECE). My recent research focuses on self-adaptive service-based systems. My research interests include mobile and ubiquitous computing, context-awareness, security in mobile systems, bioinformatics and machine learning.
